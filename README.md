# Machine-Learning-Yearning
The Draft Version of "Machine Learning Yearning"- Prof Andrew Ng.'

Prof. Andrew Ng. : 
>Machine Learning Yearning is to teach you how to structure Machine Learning projects.
AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning are transforming numerous industries. 
I have been writing a book, Machine Learning Yearning, to teach you how to structure Machine Learning projects.

>This book is focused not on teaching you ML algorithms, but on how to make ML algorithms work. Some technical AI classes will give you a hammer; this book teaches you how to use the hammer. If you aspire to be a technical leader in AI and want to learn how to set direction for your team, this book will help.

>After reading Machine Learning Yearning, you will be able to:

​Prioritize the most promising directions for an AI project

​Diagnose errors in a machine learning system

​Build ML in complex settings, such as mismatched training/test sets

​Set up an ML project to compare to and/or surpass human-level performance

​Know when and how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning

 
>Historically, the only way to learn how to make these "strategy" decisions has been a multi-year apprenticeship in a graduate program or company. I am writing Machine Learning Yearning to help you quickly gain this skill so that you can become better at building AI systems. 

>The book will be around 100 pages, and contain many easy-to-read 1-2 page chapters.
